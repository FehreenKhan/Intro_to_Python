#A customizable version of the classic "hello world!" program in main.py which, instead of saying "hello world!", prompts the user for their name and then says hello to them! 
#using the following Python console functions:
#input gets input from the user, as a string. You can, and should, store the user input into a variable:
# result = input("prompt")
# print writes to the console:
# print("hello")


def main():
     
    name=input("What is your name?")
    print(f" Hello {name}")
