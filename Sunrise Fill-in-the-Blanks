"""
Example of a Fill in the Blank program, like the one from the lesson.
The user will enter three words (a color, an adjective and a goal).
We will then turn them into a one sentence story.

    adjective = input("An adjective:") 
    goal = input("A goal you would like to achieve:")
    print(f"At dawn the sky turned {color}, and the air felt {adjective}. I decided today I will finally {goal}.")


#for example I can input in the function when running the code: A color: pink    
#An adjective: friendly   
#A goal you would like to achieve: learn to code   
# to get the following sentence print - At dawn the sky turned pink, and the air felt friendly. I decided today I will finally learn to code.
