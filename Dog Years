Write a program which asks a user to input an age in human years, and converts it to the equivalent age in dog years.
Dogs have different lifespans than humans. Thus their age is sometimes reported in "dog years" which are scaled to be comparable to human ages. 
On average every calendar year is equal to 7.18 dog years. To convert 3 calendar years to dog years, you multiply 3 * 7.18 to get 21.54 dog years. 
That means, if your dog is 3 years old, they're past their teenage years!

The program will take in an age in calendar years, multiply that age by 7.18 and report the resulting dog years.

# Each year for a human is like 7.18 years for a dog
DOG_YEARS_MULTIPLIER = 7.18  

def main():
    age = float(input("Enter an age in calendar years:"))
    print(f"That's {age * DOG_YEARS_MULTIPLIER} in dog years!")

    



if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
