The Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates the value of the first number multiplied with the second. The program should perform the following tasks:
After printing "This program multiplies two numbers."

1. Prompt the user to enter the first number.

2. Read the input and convert it to an integer.

3. Prompt the user to enter the second number.

4. Read the input and convert it to an integer.

5. Calculate the value of multiplying the two numbers.

6. Print the value


# In order to pass the tests you will need very specific prompts:

#num1 = input("Enter first number: ")
#num2 = input("Enter second number: ")
